After downloading the most recent `ArcGISMapsSDK.zip` open `samples_project` in Unreal Engine 5.0. Extract the Zip file into `arcgis-maps-sdk-unreal-engine-samples\sample_project\Plugins` folder.

Then launch Unreal Engine and open the Sample Viewer level.

To add a new level add a new entry to the SamplesDataTable.

## PR Process

Especially as we begin the process of figuring out how we structure our new samples the more the merrier on your PRs. Also while this is private PRs can be created against main. Testing on as many devices as possible and stating what testing has been done is also a good idea.

## Issue management

If you find a bug with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for Unreal Engine or with this sample viewer you can create an issue here. Same goes for a feature request on the sample viewer.
