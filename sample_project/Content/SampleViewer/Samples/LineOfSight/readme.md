# Determine the visibility for a line of sight

Determine if the line of sight is obstructed by any object in the scene.

## How to use the sample

1. Open **LineOfSight** level.
2. Click on **ArcGISMapActor** in the **Outliner**.
3. Set your API key in the **Details** panel.
4. Click play and see the line color change to red if there is any object obstructing the sight.

## How it works

1. Have an ArcGIS Map with the [mesh collider](https://developers.arcgis.com/unreal-engine/maps/mesh-collider/) enabled.
2. Have a camera with the [**ArcGIS Camera Component**](https://developers.arcgis.com/unreal-engine/maps/camera/#arcgis-camera-component) attached for the area.
3. Have an Actor for checking line of sight (**LineOfSight** Actor) and another for defining the path that the target object is moving along (**WayPoints** Actor).
4. The moiving object's path is defined by [Spline Components](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/blueprint-spline-components-overview-in-unreal-engine/).
5. The **LineOfSignt** Actor looks for an instance of the **WayPoints** Actor and performs a [line trace](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/BlueprintAPI/Collision/LineTraceByChannel/) between them at each frame. 
    - Any actors that unintentionally intersect the trace can be added to the `Actors to Ignore` of the line trace in the **LineOfSignt** Actor blueprint. 
    - The visual cue for the line of sight changes its color depending on whether the line trace hits the target object or not.

## About the data

Building models for New York are loaded from a [3D object scene layer](https://tiles.arcgis.com/tiles/z2tnIkrLQ2BRzr6P/arcgis/rest/services/New_York_LoD2_3D_Buildings/SceneServer/layers/0) hosted by Esri.

Elevation data is loaded from the [Terrain 3D layer](https://elevation3d.arcgis.com/arcgis/rest/services/WorldElevation3D/Terrain3D/ImageServer) hosted by Esri.
