# Explore with a third-person character

Allows users to explore a city/map from the perspective of a third-person character. This sample contains both a C++ and blueprint version with identical functionality.

## How to use the sample

1. Open the **ThirdPerson** or **ThirdPersonBluePrintOnly** level.
2. Click on the **ArcGISMapActor** in the Outliner panel.
3. Set your API key under the **Authentication** section in the Details panel.
4. Click play and move the character by using the WASD keys and the right mouse button. Jump with the space key.

Note: The terrain needs to be loaded before the Third Person Character falls on the ground. Adjust the `Z` Location value of the **BP_ThirdPersonCharacter** (or **ThirdPersonCharacterBluePrintVersion** if you are using the blueprint sample) in order to gain more time for the terrain to be loaded if it's necessary.

## How it works

1. Set up **ArcGIS Map** for the exploration area.
2. Create a Third Person Character with its control and attach the [**ArcGIS Camera Component**](https://developers.arcgis.com/unreal-engine/maps/camera/#arcgis-camera-component) to the Character Mesh.
3. Add the Third Person Character to the level.
   - Mesh colliders need to be enabled in the **ArcGIS Map Component**.
   - If you want to place the character in a specific location, attach the [**ArcGIS Location Component**](https://developers.arcgis.com/unreal-engine/maps/location-component/) to specify it.
   - Adjust the `Z` Location value of the character to have enough time to load the terrain.
